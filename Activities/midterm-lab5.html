      <h2>Problem #1</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        In this problem, you are asked to create a User class that represents a social media user. The class should have the following attributes: first_name, last_name, followers_count, and friends_name (which should be a list). These attributes must be initialized using a constructor. You will also need to include two methods. The first method, introduce_self, should display a message saying “Hi I am {first_name} {last_name}.” The second method, view_full_profile, should print all the user’s information in this format: “Profile Name is Bradd Pitt with 10 followers. Friends are… Juan Pedro Jose.”
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        After creating the User class, you need to make a separate class called TestUser to test if your program works properly. This class should allow user input to be passed as parameters when creating the object. Finally, create at least two object instances to test the User class and verify that both methods function as expected.
      </p>
